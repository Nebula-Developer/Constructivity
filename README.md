A C# sentence generator, similar to Lorem Ipsum.

# Usage
To use Constructivity, you must first add the ***Construct.cs***,
and the optional ***Question.cs*** files to your project. These are located
in the **'Constructivity'** folder.

### (There is a demo inside of Program.cs.)

Then, in your main project, use the following to make a sentence generator:
`Construct.NewRandomSentence(int: Length, bool: UseOddChars, bool: UsePuncuation);`
OR
`Construct.NewModernSentence(int: Length, bool: UsePunctuation);`
OR
`Construct.RandomChars(int: Length);`

To look into these functions, either type in `Construct.` and look at the intellisense
results, or have a look at the demo. It is very simple to learn, and is also very powerful
at the same time.
